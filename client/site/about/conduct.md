# Euphorian Code of Conduct  *updated Sep 30, 2015*


## Purpose

The primary goal of Euphoria is to be inclusive to the largest number of
people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are
devoted to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, race, or
socioeconomic status.

As online citizens, we must recognize the relationships between our actions and
their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they
exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of
inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. We invite all those who
participate in Euphoria to help us create safe and positive experiences for
everyone. Remember: there is a human on the other side of the screen.


## Rules

In furtherance of these goals, the following behaviors are prohibited:

 * Threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.

 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise
   discriminatory jokes, insults, or language.

 * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
   information ("doxing") or posting of non-harassing private communication
   without consent.

 * Inappropriate sexual attention or unwelcome sexual advances. Misreading the
   tone of the situation is no excuse.

 * Deliberate intimidation or stalking.

 * Creating rooms for porn, or gratuitous posting of porn. While conversations
   of a sexual nature may occur in some spaces, Euphoria is not a porn site.

 * Spamming, flooding, or unauthorized advertising.

 * Maliciously impersonating any real person or entity, including but not
   limited to a Euphoria staff member or volunteer, or otherwise
   misrepresenting your affiliation with any person or entity.

 * Breaking Euphoria, making it so others canâ€™t use the site, or using Euphoria
   to break other sites or services.

 * Bypassing access restrictions, evading bans, or tampering with data that has
   not been intentionally granted to you.

 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.


## Consequences

We may take various actions to enforce this Code of Conduct, including but not limited to:

 * Asking the user to stop the behavior in question.

 * Removing chat privileges for a period of time.

 * Stripping control of a room from a user and/or shutting it down.

 * Temporarily limiting what rooms a user is allowed to participate in.

 * Temporarily or permanently banning a user from Euphoria.

you have any other concerns or questions, please [contact

of Conduct, please notify Euphoria staff via
