# Room Host Policy  *updated Jan 9, 2024*


Staff are available to help you. If you have any questions or need any
assistance, please contact us. You can also ask for general advice in
[&townhall](/room/townhall).


## Responsibility

By creating a chat room, you agree to act as the administrator ("**host**") of
it and to take the responsibility to moderate the room. You agree to exclude
any participant that you believe to be in violation of Euphoriaâ€™s
[Terms of Service](/about/terms) and you agree to notify Euphoria staff about
the situation. If someone reports any content of your chat as illegal or
otherwise in breach of our terms, you will be responsible for letting Euphoria
staff know, and where necessary, taking the content down.


## Conduct

Additionally, it is your responsibility to ensure the rooms you host abide by
our [Code of Conduct](/about/conduct). Room hosts are currently granted
significant discretion in how they enforce the Code of Conduct (e.g. deleting
a comment versus banning a user). However, if a staff member feels that your
room is in breach of the Code of Conduct, they may take administrative action,
including but not limited to:

 * A friendly discussion about the issue.

 * Revocation of host privileges.

 * Shutting down rooms.

We will do our best to work with you and give opportunity to correct issues
rather than shutting down a room.


## Changes

Euphoria is currently in its early stages, our rules and guidance will change
in the future.
